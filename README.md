# Online-Grocery
I'm using PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL (database) to create a virtual online grocery store for my project in college. But I'm still a newbie to programming, and I don't know why I cannot successfully deploy my bottom-right.php file on the website while the file can run properly on my editor.
On my deployed website, the PHP file of bottom-right.php shows properly on the landing page, but when I click the "ADD" button from top-right.php file, the whole page disappears.
